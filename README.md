## Internal Styles
---
This project is about converting code using inline styles to utilizing internal styles. This is a process known as **refactoring**. You should think of your projects as a starting point that will need to be refined. When we refactor, we are taking something that is functional and making it better, _more streamlined and/or efficient_. This process is not an easy task, but you will get better with time.

### Part 1: Looking at the code..
You will notice that there is some basic code that utilizes inline styles to create a glorious color scheme. **sarcasm**. Look through _index.html_ as well as _about.html_. These are two pages that will be served up based on the current server configuration.

### Part 2: Let's reorganize some code!

### Part 3: Make the home page your home!
Restyle the home page to so that it looks like the about me page using internal styling.
Add some interesting things that you have learned to the home page. This is a good time to practice styling. You need follow the criteria below:
###### Elements _one of each_:
    - heading
    - section
    - link
    - ul
    - image
    - Challenge: Create a navigation bar that takes you to multiple pages.
###### Styling:
  You should style each of the elements to position them and make them fit next to each other. _Use these to accomplish that_
    - margin
    - padding
    - float
    - borders
